# My-Hiking-API

An Azure Functions project that provides endpoints to retrieve data from JSON files. This project demonstrates how to structure an Azure Functions app using models, services, and static data.

## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have:
- **.NET SDK 8.0**
    https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
- **Azure Functions Core Tools** 
    The Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code 
- **C# Dev Kit**
    C# extension for Visual Studio Code
Download the below packages or ensure you have them: 
- **Newtonsoft.Json**
    For JSON serialization/deserialization
- **Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http**
    for HTTP triggers 
- **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc** 
    For returning HTTP responses 

## Features 
- HTTP-triggered Azure Function
- Organised into 'Models', 'Services', and 'Data' folders
- 'JsonFilesData.cs' contains a static class and a static method, 'GetData', which reads a JSON file and returns it as a list of 'T' object e.g. if the filename specified is 'mountains.json' then this method will return a list of mountains 
- 'MountainServices.cs' contains a public class of mountains with a method which uses the 'GetData' method to return a list of mountains 
- The main entry point for the function app is: 'MyHikingAPI.cs'
